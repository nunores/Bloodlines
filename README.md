# Bloodlines

![Bloodlines trailer and demonstration](./docs/bloodlinesgif.gif)

Bloodlines is a a 3D _soulslike_ game developed with **Unity**, focusing on challenging melee combat and an immersive dark medieval setting. It was developed as a group project for the **Digital Game Design and Development** course at **FEUP**, with the game mechanics, world design, art, animations, and sound all crafted by the team from scratch.

## 🏰 The Story
A knight, whose family castle is taken from them, embarks on a perilous quest to reclaim it. The stronghold, now overrun by enemies, is vast and treacherous. But this is no ordinary fight—should the knight fall, their descendants will take up the blade. Generation after generation, the bloodline will not rest until the castle is won back.

For this unit's project, we designed and developed a 3D soulslike game with Unity. All aspects including asset creation, sound design and development were made by our team.
